Be advised, Gods Unchained is the closest thing to Rasayana we've seen. It's based on the ETH system, so there are intrinsic limitations, but they aren't stupid. Expect them to port over to Cardano eventually. The problem is they are way ahead of Rasayana on the development path already.

This bears very careful examination.
